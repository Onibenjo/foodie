# Food Finder App in React Native

This repository is a complete app UI by using different essential react native packages which is useful for creating any kind of app. Here I have used every navigator option available and combine them in a single project to create a seemless user navigation experience for the app user.

Then I have created some extra things such as login, signup & splash screen and provided an authentication flow using React Native Sensitive Info. Also I have created form validation for the login screen.
